"""Dedicated registry API resolver.

Additive resolver mode that fetches APM packages over a REST registry contract
(see docs/proposals/registry-api.md). Sits alongside the existing Git resolver;
opt-in via the top-level ``registries:`` block in ``apm.yml`` or the
``APM_ENABLE_REGISTRY=1`` environment variable.

This package is intentionally separate from ``src/apm_cli/registry/`` (the MCP
registry client) — the two address different concepts and must not be confused.
